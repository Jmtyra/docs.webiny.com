:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN

- why, at the moment, our application can be considered as not secure
- get introduced to the fundamental security-related terms: authentication and authorization
- the plan we intend to follow in the next couple of sections

## Overview

In today's world, almost all applications support file upload functionality. Be it the upload of a simple avatar image, a collection of images from a mobile device, or a 4K video,

So, in the next couple of sections, we'll continue working on our **Pinterest Clone** application by adding the file upload functionality.

Like in the previous [Security](#), we'll need to make changes to our application and cloud infrastructure code - both on the GraphQL API and React application side.

As always, before we start with any kind of coding, let's quickly outline the plan.

## The Plan

We're going to divide this section of the tutorial into four parts.

### [Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/getting-started)

To get started, we'll quickly outline a couple of base concepts we'll be using in the sections that follow:

- give an overview of the authentication flow we'll be integrating into our application - the Amazon Cognito's Hosted UI
- because we'll not only be working with our application, but also with our cloud infrastructure code, we'll dedicate a couple of sentences to explain how it's organized, explain what cloud infrastructure stack output is, and more

### [Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/cloud-infrastructure/adding-user-pool-and-user-pool-domain)

This is where we'll start working with our cloud infrastructure code, which will enable us to deploy additional Amazon Cognito-related cloud infrastructure resources. We'll be doing this partly on the GraphQL API and partly on the React application side.

### [GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/graphql-api/initial-setup)

Finally, once our users are able to sign up and sign in to our application, we'll complete our application's security layer by implementing authentication and authorization checks on the GraphQL API side, within our resolver functions.

### [React Application](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/react-application/initial-setup)

Once all of the needed cloud infrastructure resources have been deployed, we can start integrating the mentioned Amazon Cognito's Hosted UI into our React application.
