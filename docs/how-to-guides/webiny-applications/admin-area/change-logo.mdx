- how to replace the default Webiny logo with your own React component

:::info Prerequisites
To use the instructions presented in this guide, you need to know how to register Webiny plugins in your React applications. Please visit the [Importing Plugins](/docs/how-to-guides/importing-plugins) guide, if you're not already familiar with the process.

## Overview

Changing the default logo is a very quick and straightforward process. The main Admin Area layout is built using the [UI Composer](/docs/key-topics/ui-composer/introduction). This means that you can hook into any part of the view and modify it.

The two views that you'll need to hook into are the [AdminView](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/app-admin/src/ui/views/AdminView.tsx) and [NavigationView](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/app-admin/src/ui/views/NavigationView.tsx).

## Replace the Logo in the Header

To replace the logo in the main header, we need to hook into the [AdminView](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/app-admin/src/ui/views/AdminView.tsx) class and access the header element, which contains a `setLogo` setter.

```tsx
// Hook into the AdminView view
new UIViewPlugin<AdminView>(AdminView, view => {
  view.getHeaderElement().setLogo(<MyLogo />);
});
```

Note that `<MyLogo />` has to be a React element. This allows you to have your logo be as simple or as complex as necessary.

## Replace the Logo in the Navigation Drawer

There is a second logo, in the navigation drawer, which looks different from the one in the AdminView header. The view class responsible for the navigation drawer is the [NavigationView](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/app-admin/src/ui/views/NavigationView.tsx) class.

```tsx
new UIViewPlugin<NavigationView>(NavigationView, view => {
  view.getHeaderElement().setLogo(<Logo onClick={() => view.getNavigationHook().hideMenu()} />);
});
```

Here we also want to close the drawer when the logo is clicked, so we use the built-in view hook to access state management operations, and invoke `hideMenu` on logo click.
